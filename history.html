<h1>THE HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF SHOES</h1>
	

<div class="content">

<p>A shoe is an outer shoe that covers the foot. 
It is often made of leather, has a thick or committed simply and typically reaches no higher than the ankle (which sets it apart from a boot).
<p>
Climate data reveals that by around 50,000 years ago, individuals were most likely shielding their feet from extremely cold temperatures. Approximately 40,000 years ago, individuals were wearing footwear with large feet, as evidenced by changes in toe strength and foot form. Still, until around 9,000 years ago is the first known example of real footwear, a pair of sandals discovered in California, U.S.A.The Kassites, who governed Babylonia between 1600 and 1200 BCE, brought soft shoes to Mesopotamia through their mountain people who lived on Iran's border. The original kind of shoe was a straightforward leather wraparound with a moccasin-like design, fastened to the foot with leather laces. Greek women wore sandals or went barefoot most of the time. However, during the Hellenistic era, they occasionally wore soft closed shoes, which were considered luxury and were best worn in red or white. The Etruscans wore high, laced shoes with turned-up feet until the 5th century BCE, when Greek influence took over. The Romans had shoe unions and created shoes with left- or right-foot shapes. They had separate shoe categories based on rank and gender.
<p>
During the Middle Ages, people wore basic shoes. Initially, they wore untanned leather sneakers, which subsequently evolved into ankle-tying or buckling styles. English shoe sizing originated in 1305, most likely, when Edward I ordered that one inch (2.5 cm) equaled three dry barleycorns. As a result, a child's shoe measuring thirteen barleycorns became a size 13. The 14th and 15th centuries saw the dramatic broadening and pointiness of shoes. A statute passed by King Edward III stated that the spikes, or points, on shoes must not be longer than two inches (5 cm). However, during the reign of Richard II (1377‚Äì99), shoes, also known as crakows, had points that were up to eighteen inches (45 cm) or longer. Men's shoes from the 16th century featured very wide toes that resembled duck wings. The range of shoe designs expanded, with uppers composed of leather, silk, or cork and bottoms made of either material. As with clothing, it was also common practice to cut shoes to expose a colored lining. Women's shoes were comparable to men's, but because their dresses were voluminous, they were less noticeable.
<p>
In Europe during the 17th century, boots were typically worn. Shoes featured quite tall heels and often came with sizable lace and ribbon rosettes. Both men and women in America wore sturdy leather shoes with a modest heel. Real or fake jewels and buckles made of gold and silver were used to decorate shoes throughout the 18th century. Women's dress shoes in America were modeled after those in France and England. They were constructed of brocade, had a French heel, and typically had a buckle. A patten, or overshoe, was worn over the shoe to preserve it. The first shoe factory opened for business in Massachusetts around 1760, marking the start of mass production of shoes. But it wasn't until the 19th century with the invention of contemporary tools like the sewing machine that shoes could be produced efficiently and affordably. The 20th century saw the creation of shoes in countless styles, colors, and patterns.

<p>Leather has been used to make shoes from the beginning of time. The best men's and women's shoes are made of premium cow leather. Side leather, which is created from cattle hide and named so because the huge hide is divided into two sides for handling by cutting it along the middle lengthwise, is the most adaptable leather and is used for many different types of shoes.
<p>Goatskin is used to make kid leather, which has been used for men's slippers and women's dress shoes. 
<p>Slippers and coverings are made of sheepskin. Women's and certain men's shoes are made from leathers that are made from snake, lizard, and alligator skins. For men's shoes, a thick leather called cordovan‚Äîa thin layer of muscle derived from horsehide‚Äîis chosen. Typically crafted from cow skin, patent leather has a smooth, firm surface. 
<p>Suede is created by polishing the inside surface of various leathers, such as calf, kid, or cattle skin, to create a napped finish.
<p>Rubber and plastic are gradually replacing leather in shoes, even though leather is still the most popular material overall. This is especially true for shoe heels and other parts. 
<p>Fabrics for the linings and uppers might be coated or natural. 
<p>Plastic may be used for soaking, heels, and counters (heel stiffeners). 
<p>Nowadays, the majority of outside and inner soles are made without leather. Many textures and motifs that mimic the grain of leather may be created on a cloth foundation that has been chemically surface-finished. Shoes can also be made of synthetic suede and patent. These days, materials fulfill performance criteria and are less expensive. Some textiles, such as silk, satin, and linen, are also utilized to make shoes.</p>
